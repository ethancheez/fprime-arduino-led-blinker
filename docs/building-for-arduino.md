# Building for Arduino Microcontrollers

This section will guide you on converting your project to build for Arduino microcontrollers using the `fprime-arduino` package.

## Adding fprime-arduino

First, add the `fprime-arduino` package as a submodule into your project root.

```shell
# In led-blinker
git submodule add https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-arduino.git
```

Add `fprime-arduino` as a library and change the default build toolchain to `teensy41` in `led-blinker/settings.ini` after the framework path.
```
library_locations: ./fprime-arduino
default_toolchain: teensy41
```

## Test Deployment

Test the new teensy41 build by running:

```shell
fprime-util generate
fprime-util build
```

If you wish to test other Arduino build, append the build name after `fprime-util generate` and `fprime-util build`. Tested boards are listed below (build name in parenthesis):
- Teensy 4.1 (teensy41)
- Adafruit Feather M0 (featherM0)

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You are now able to build an FÂ´ deployment for Arduino microcontrollers! The next step is to reduce the amount of memory used so it can support hardware with limited memory.

### Next Step: [Component Design and Initial Implementation](./component-implementation-1.md).

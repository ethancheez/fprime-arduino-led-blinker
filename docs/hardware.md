# LED Blinker: Hardware Requirements

Users will need at least one hardware element to follow the LED Blinker tutorial: an embedded Arduino-based microcontroller with an on-board LED. If there is no on-board LED, you will need an external LED capable of withstanding the operating voltage.

## Arduino Microcontroller Requirements

The microcontroller must have sufficient FLASH memory and SRAM to run FÂ´. The current requirements are at least 140 KB of FLASH memory and 30 KB of SRAM.

## LED Requirements

The user may use any LED that can withstand the GPIO voltage of the chosen platform (typically 3.3 volts). This usually means choosing an LED with sufficient diode drop or inlining a resistor.

## Wiring Diagram

For this tutorial, the on-board LED pin will be used (LED_BUILTIN). For most Arduino microcontrollers, this is GPIO pin 13. For platforms that do not have an on-board LED pin readily available, another pin should be chosen, noted, and used in-place of LED_BUILTIN (13).

```
GPIO LED_BUILTIN (13) ----> LED + (cathode) 
GND                   <---- LED - (anode)     
```
